= Introduction =

PowerPointLaTeX is a small add-in that allows you to embed LaTeX math code into your !PowerPoint 2007 presentations in a user-friendly way.
It uses a web-service to render the LaTeX code (currently it uses the equation editor from http://www.codecogs.com/). Support for MikeTEX and other LaTeX web-services is planned.

= Details =

PowerPointLaTeX adds a new ribbon to !PowerPoint 2007:

There are two different types of equations: inline equations and formulas.
Inline equations can be added anywhere in-between normal text. Simply wrap your LaTeX math code in a pair of $$: "Some integral $$ \int x \, dx = {1 \over  2} x^2 + C$$".

Formulas are stand-alone objects. You can create them by using the Ribbon button "New Formula".
To edit a formula click onto it and a text shape will appear that contains its LaTeX code.
Deselect it and it will automatically compile it.

PowerPointLaTeX caches the compiled formulas, so you don't need an active internet connection if you don't change anything.

= Known Issues =

If you have huge LaTeX formulas PowerPoint's Auto-Fit feature might kick in. It's toxic to PowerPointLaTeX's inline formula embedding feature - the formulas will end up in the wrong place. Simply disable Auto-Fit for those text shapes and adapt the font size manually.
